Project:

HealthCare_EDA: Exploratory Data Analysis on Hospitals and Their Patients

Technologies Used:

Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, plotly.express, plotly.graph_objects)

Description:

This dataset contains information about patients admitted to a hospital, including demographic details, medical conditions, treatments, and billing information. The dataset includes the following columns:

Name: Names of patients admitted to the hospital.

Age: Age of patients at the time of admission.

Gender: Gender of patients (e.g., male, female).

Blood Type: Blood type of the patients.

Medical Condition: Description of the medical condition or diagnosis for which the patient was admitted.

Admission Date: Date when the patient was admitted to the hospital.

Doctor: Name or identifier of the physician responsible for the patient's care.

Hospital: Name or identifier of the hospital where the patient was admitted.

Insurance Provider: Name of the insurance company covering the patient's medical expenses.

Billing Amount: Amount billed to the patient or their insurance provider for medical services received during the hospital stay.

Room Number: Identifier of the room where the patient is accommodated.

Admission Type: Type of admission, such as emergency, elective, or transfer.

Discharge Date: Date when the patient was discharged from the hospital.

Medications: List of medications prescribed to the patient during hospitalization.

Test Results: Results of medical tests performed on the patient during their hospital stay.
